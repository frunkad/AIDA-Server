# AIDA-server

Server to control all requests directed to my IoT devices in home

For my use case, I found using paho library for browser which uses websockets better

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# Transpile Typescript and run server at localhost:3000
yarn dev

# Transpile files
yarn build
```
